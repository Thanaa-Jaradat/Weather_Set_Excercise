🌤️ Weather Data Analysis Project
This project explores and analyzes weather data collected over a short period in 2006. The dataset includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related readings recorded every 10 minutes.

📊 What This Project Does
The goal was to dive into the dataset, explore it in depth, and answer meaningful questions through Python-based data analysis and visualization. The tasks were designed as a self-guided learning exercise to improve data handling, aggregation, and plotting skills using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

✅ Key Analyses Performed
Basic Exploration

Viewed dataset shape, data types, and summary statistics

Listed unique values per column

Temperature Analysis

Calculated average daily and weekly outside temperatures

Found days with highest and lowest temperature differences

Identified time of day when the outside temperature typically peaks

Found the most common time for daily temperature highs

Extracted top 10 highest temperatures on distinct days

Special Conditions

Isolated dates where high temperature was close to 22.3°C or low temperature near 10.3°C within the first 9 days of June

Visualizations

Monthly temperature trends

Highest daily temperatures for the first 5 days of each month

Correlation between temperature, humidity, and wind speed

Scatter plot showing the relationship between temperature and humidity

📁 Output Files
Outside_Temperature.txt contains insights like average hottest time, most frequent hottest time, and top hottest days.

Hi_Temperature.txt lists dates/times meeting specific temperature thresholds.

🔍 What I Was Practicing
This project was a personal exercise to:

Practice reading and transforming time-series data

Use grouping and aggregation in pandas

Work with date and time columns effectively

Apply conditional filtering for custom logic

Build clear and intuitive visualizations
